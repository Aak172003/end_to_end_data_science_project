1️⃣ First rule: Judge models on the TEST set

Training metrics mostly tell you how well the model memorized the data, not how well it generalizes.

2️⃣ Compare Test-set performance (side-by-side thinking)
🔹 Best R² (higher = better)

| Model             | Test R²      |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| **Ridge**         | **0.8806** ⭐ |
| Linear Regression | 0.8804       |
| Random Forest     | 0.8530       |
| CatBoost          | 0.8516       |
| AdaBoost          | 0.8496       |
| XGBoost           | 0.8278       |
| Lasso             | 0.8253       |
| KNN               | 0.7837       |
| Decision Tree     | 0.7179       |

➡ Ridge ≈ Linear Regression are best




🔹 Lowest RMSE (lower = better)

| Model             | Test RMSE    |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| **Ridge**         | **5.3904** ⭐ |
| Linear Regression | 5.3940       |
| Random Forest     | 5.9810       |
| CatBoost          | 6.0086       |
| AdaBoost          | 6.0487       |
| XGBoost           | 6.4733       |
| Lasso             | 6.5197       |
| KNN               | 7.2553       |
| Decision Tree     | 8.2846       |


➡ Ridge & Linear Regression win again


🔹 Lowest MAE (lower = better)


| Model             | Test MAE     |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| **Ridge**         | **4.2111** ⭐ |
| Linear Regression | 4.2148       |
| Random Forest     | 4.5887       |
| CatBoost          | 4.6125       |
| AdaBoost          | 4.7498       |
| XGBoost           | 5.0577       |
| Lasso             | 5.1579       |
| KNN               | 5.6280       |
| Decision Tree     | 6.4850       |

➡ Ridge is consistently the best




3️⃣ Overfitting check (VERY important 🚨)

Look at train vs test gap:

❌ Bad (overfitting)

Decision Tree

Train R² = 0.9997 😱

Test R² = 0.7179
👉 Memorized data, failed to generalize

XGBoost

Train R² = 0.9955

Test R² = 0.8278
👉 Overfitting

✅ Good (stable & reliable)

Linear Regression

Ridge

Train ≈ Test metrics

Small error gap

5️⃣ How to explain this in interviews / reports 🎯

“Although advanced models like XGBoost and Random Forest performed very well on training data, they showed signs of overfitting. Ridge Regression achieved the best balance between bias and variance, giving the lowest test error and highest R², making it the most reliable model.”


1️⃣ The simplest signal of overfitting (golden rule)

👉 Compare TRAIN vs TEST performance


1️⃣ The simplest signal of overfitting (golden rule)

👉 Compare TRAIN vs TEST performance

If:

Train score is very high

Test score drops a lot

➡ Overfitting

If:

Train ≈ Test
➡ Good generalization

If:

Both are bad
➡ Underfitting


2️⃣ Let’s apply this rule to your actual results
❌ Decision Tree (classic overfitting example)
Train R² = 0.9997
Test  R² = 0.7179


Red flags 🚩

Almost perfect on training

Big drop on test

Train RMSE = 0.27 vs Test RMSE = 8.28

👉 This model memorized the training data

❌ XGBoost
Train R² = 0.9955
Test  R² = 0.8278


Huge gap

Very low train error

Worse test error than simple linear models

👉 Overfitting (less severe, but still there)

⚠️ Random Forest / CatBoost
Random Forest:
Train R² = 0.9757
Test  R² = 0.8530


Moderate gap

Some overfitting

Acceptable but not optimal

✅ Ridge / Linear Regression (healthy models)
Ridge:
Train R² = 0.8743
Test  R² = 0.8806


Almost identical

Even test slightly better (normal due to randomness)

👉 Excellent generalization

3️⃣ Quantify overfitting (simple metric)

You can compute a generalization gap:

Overfitting Gap = Train R² – Test R²

Example:
Model	Gap
Decision Tree	0.2818 🚨
XGBoost	0.1677
Random Forest	0.1227
Ridge	-0.0063 ✅
Linear	-0.0061 ✅

📌 Rule of thumb

Gap > 0.10 → overfitting risk

Gap ≈ 0 → good

Gap < 0 → very stable
